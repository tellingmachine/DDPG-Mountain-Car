# DDPG-Mountain-Car
DDPG algo

This is a simple implementation of the DDPG actor-critic algorithm from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf
It uses and solves OpenAI Gym's Continuous Mountain Car environment.

Note: this code is somewhat hacky and not written for higher dimensional problems. Batch Norm is not used.
